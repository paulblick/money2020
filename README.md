=========

We cannot wait to talk with everyone and geek out on payments APIs at the Money 20/20 Hackathon.

You will find much information in this repo that will hopefully provide you with enough information to get going quickly.

Do APIs matter? At the end of the Money2020 Hackathon Mercury would like to emphatically say, ‘YES!’  A payment API can’t solve the world’s problems….or can it? Use one of Mercury’s API’s (Web Services, Hosted Checkout or Mobile wallet) and show everyone how a simple payments engine and a little creativity can change the world
