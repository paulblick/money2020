#Overview

We cannot wait to meet everyone and geek out on payment APIs at the Money 20/20 Hackathon November 1st and 2nd.  This repo is to provide you a quickstart to integrating to Mercury APIs.

#Challenge

Do APIs matter? At the end of the Money2020 Hackathon Mercury would like to emphatically say, ‘YES!’

A payment API can’t solve the world’s problems….or can it? Use one of Mercury’s API’s (Web Services, Hosted Checkout or Mobile wallet) and show everyone how a simple payments engine and a little creativity can change the world

#Samples in this repo

We use curl to facilitate transaction processing in this repo as it is a simple utility and easily installed (if not installed by default).  But have a look around at our sample code and you will start to see an infinite number of ways to send transactions to the Mercury platform.
